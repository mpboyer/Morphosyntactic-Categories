Comparative Concepts or Descriptive Categories: a UD Case study
In this paper, we present a series of methods used to quantify the soundness of using the same names to annotate cases in different languages.
We follow the idea described by Martin Haspelmath that descriptive categories and comparative concepts are different objects and we look at the necessary simplification taken by the Universal Dependencies project. 
We thus compare cases in closely related languages as belonging to commensurable descriptive categories.
Then we look at the corresponding underlying comparative concepts.
Before eventually looking at the possibility to assign cases to adpositions.
